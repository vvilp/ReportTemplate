I would like to express my utmost appreciation to my supervisor, Associate Professor Jim Hogan, for his patience, motivation and inspiration throughout the course of my master’s degree. I would like to extend my gratitude to my associate supervisor, Dr Wayne Kelly, for providing me with his guidance during my research period, and specific and detailed comments on my thesis draft. This work could not have been conducted without their continual advice and reassurance. I would like to thank Dr Guido Zuccon, Lawrence Buckingham and Dr Timothy Chappell for providing lots of advice and suggestions for this work.

Finally, it is necessary to acknowledge QUT for its support during my master’s degree. During this research, I attended several bioinformatics seminars and symposiums, as well as other tutorial classes. Not only have these experiences expanded my knowledge in this particular field, but they have also improved overall logic, precision and scientific attitude in other aspects of my life.
