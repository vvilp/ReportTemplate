abstract = {T HE DEVELOPMENT OF SEQUENCE ANALYSIS METHODS has depended on the contributions of many individuals from varied scientific backgrounds. This chapter provides a brief histor- ical account of the more significant advances that have taken place, as well as an overview of the chapters of this book. Because many contributors cannot be mentioned due to space constraints, additional references to earlier and current reference books, articles, reviews, and journals provide a broader view of the field and are included in the reference lists to this chapter.},
